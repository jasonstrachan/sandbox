# Polygon Drawing Sandbox

Interactive canvas demo with multiple polygon fill modes.

## Getting Started

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build for deployment: `npm run build`
- Preview the production build locally: `npm run preview`

The production-ready assets are emitted to `dist/` and can be deployed to your dev environment as-is.
